    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, everyone! I'm Hosea Evans, a 15-year-old student at St. Edmund Campion in grade nine, passionate about both web design and Excel spreadsheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I've been learning the ropes of web design, and creating websites for fun projects and school assignments. But that's not allâ€”I also volunteer at my local church, helping out with events, organizing donation drives, and even designing posters and flyers to spread the word about upcoming activities.
